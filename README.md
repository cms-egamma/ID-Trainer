# ID-Trainer

> A simple config-based tool for high-energy-physics machine learning tasks.


Currently supports:
* **Binary-classification** (currently using XGBoost and DNN)
Examples: DY vs ttbar, DY prompt vs DY fake
* **Multi-sample classification** (currently using XGBoost and DNN)
Examples: DY vs (ttbar and QCD)
* **Multi-class classification** (currently using XGBoost and DNN)
Examples: DY vs ttbar vs QCD


Salient features:
1) Parallel reading of root files (using DASK)
2) Runs on flat ntuples (even NanoAODs) out of the box
3) Adding multiple MVAs is very trivial (Subject to available computing power)
4) Cross-section and pt-eta reweighting can be handled together
5) Multi-Sample training possible
6) Multi-Class training possible
7) Ability to customize thresholds

### What will be the output of the trainer:

1) Feature distributions
2) Statistics in training and testing
3) ROCs, loss plots, MVA scores
4) Confusion Matrices
5) Correlation plots
6) Trained models (h5 or pkl files)

#### Optional outputs

1) Threshold values of scores for chosen working points
2) Efficiency vs pT and Efficiency vs eta plots for all classes
3) Reweighting plots for pT and eta
4) Comparison of new ID performance with benchmark ID flags

# Setting up

#### Clone
```
git clone https://github.com/cms-egamma/ID-Trainer.git
```
#### Setup
In principle, you can set this up on your local computer by installing packages via conda/pip, but when possible please set up a cvmfs release.

#### Run on CPUs only

Use LCG 97python3 and you will have all the dependencies! (Tested at lxplus and SWAN)
`source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_97python3/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/setup.sh`

#### Run on GPUs

The code can also transparently use a GPU, if a GPU card is available. Although, all packages need to be setup correctly.
For GPU in tensorflow, you can use a cvmfs release is available:
`source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_97py3cu10/x86_64-centos7-gcc7-opt/setup.sh`

For XGBoost, while the code will use it automatically, it needs a GPU compiled XGBoost with CUDA >10.0. This is at the moment not possible with any cvmfs release.
You can cartainly setup packages locally.


### Running the trainer

#### Create a config
Create a new python config. Some sample python configs are available in the 'Configs' folder. They cover the most possible examples. All you need to do is to edit the config with the settings for your analysis and then run:

```
python Trainer.py NewTrainConfig #without the .py
```

The Trainer will read the settings from the config file and run training

Projects where the framework has been helpful

1) Run-3 Electron MVA ID
2) Run-3 PF Electron ID
3) Run-3 PF Photon ID
4) Close photon analysis
5) H->eeg analysis

### The different parts of the config

#### Imports
This is needed to use numpy and tensorflow. You can leave it as is.
```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Activation
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
```


# All the Parameters

| Parameters |Type| Description|
| --------------- | ----------------| ---------------- |
| `OutputDirName` |string| All plots, models, config file will be stored in this directory. This will be automatically created. If it already exists, it will overwrite everything if you run it again with the same `OutputDirName`|
| `branches` |list of strings| Branches to read (Should be in the input root files). Only these branches can be later used for any purpose. The '\*' is useful for selecting pattern-based branches. In principle one can do ``` branches=["*"] ```, but remember that the data loading time increases, if you select more branches|
|`SaveDataFrameCSV`|boolean| If True, this will save the data frame as a parquet file and the next time you run the same training with different parameters, it will be much faster|
|`loadfromsaved`|boolean| If root files and branches are the same as previous training and SaveDataFrameCSV was True, you can assign this as `True`, and data loading time will reduce significantly. Remember that this will use the same output directory as mentioned using `OutputDirName`, so the data frame should be present there|
|`Classes` | list of strings | Two or more classes possible. For two classes the code will do a binary classification. For more than two classes Can be anything but samples will be later loaded under this scheme. Example: `Classes=['DY','TTBar']` or `Classes=['Class1','Class2','Class3']`. The order is important if you want to make an ID. In case of two classes, the first class has to be a Signal of interest. The second has to be a background. In multiclass, it does not matter which order one is using, but it is highly recommended that the first class is signal, if it is known. |
|`ClassColors`|list of strings|Colors for `Classes` to use in plots. Standard python colors work!|
|`Tree`| string |Location of the tree inside the root file|
|`processes`| list of dictionaries| You can add as many process files as you like and assign them to a specific class. For example WZ.root and TTBar.root could be 'Background' class and DY.root could be 'Signal' or both 'Signal and 'background' can come from the same root file. In fact you can have, as an example: 4 classes and 5 root files. The Trainer will take care of it at the backend. Look at the sample config below to see how processes are added. It is a list of dictionaries, with one example dictionary looking like this ` {'Class':'IsolatedSignal','path':['./DY.root','./Zee.root'], 'xsecwt': 1, 'selection':'(ele_pt > 5) & (abs(scl_eta) < 1.442) & (abs(scl_eta) < 2.5) & (matchedToGenEle==1)'} ` |
|`MVAs`|list of dictionaries| MVAs to use. You can add as many as you like: MVAtypes XGB and DNN are keywords, so names can be XGB_new, DNN_old etc, but keep XGB and DNN in the names (That is how the framework identifies which algo to run). Look at the sample config below to see how MVAs are added. |

#### Optional Parameters

| Parameters          |Type| Description| Default value|
| --------------- | ----------------| ---------------- | ---------------- |
|`Reweighing`|boolean| This is independent of xsec reweighing (this reweighing will be done after taking into account xsec weight of multiple samples). Even if this is 'False', xsec reweighting will always be done. To switch off xsec reweighting, you can just assign the xsec weight is `1`| False |
|`ptbins`,`etabins`|lists of numbers| $p_T$ and $\eta$ bins of interest (will be used for robustness studies: function coming soon) and will also be used for 2D $p_T$-$\eta$ reweighing if the `Reweighing` option is `True`|Not activated until Reweighing==True |
|`ptwtvar`,`etawtvar`|strings| names of $p_T$ and $\eta$ branches|Not activated until Reweighing==True|
|`WhichClassToReweightTo`|string|  2D $p_T$-$\eta$ spectrum of all other classes will be reweighted to this class|Not activated until Reweighing==True|
|`OverlayWP`|list of strings| Working Point Flags to compare to (Should be in your ntuple and should also be read in branches)|empty list|
|`OverlayWPColors`|list of strings| Working Point Flags colors in plot|empty list|
|`SigEffWPs`| list of strings | To print thresholds of mva scores for corresponding signal efficiency, example `["80%","90%"]` (Add as many as you would like) |empty list|
|`testsize`|float| In fraction, how much data to use for testing (0.3 means 30%)| 0.2|
|`flatten`       |boolean| For NanoAOD and other un-flattened trees, you can assign this as `True` to flatten branches with variable length for each event (Event level -> Object level)| False |
| `Debug`         |boolean| If True, only a small subset of events/objects are used for either Signal or background. Useful for quick debugging of code| False |
|`RandomState`|integer |Choose the same number every time for reproducibility| 42|
|`MVAlogplot`|boolean| If true, MVA outputs are plotted in log scale| False|
|`Multicore`|boolean| If True all CPU cores available are used XGB | True|

#### How to add variables? or modify the ones that are in tree

| Function         |Type| Description| Default value|
| --------------- | ----------------| ---------------- | ---------------- |
|`modifydf`|function| In your config, you can add a function with this exact name `modifydf` which accepts a pandas dataframe and manipulates it and then returns 0. Using this you can add new variables or modify already present variables. Example: `def modifydf(df): df['A']=df[X]+df[Y]; return 0;` This will add a new branch named 'A'.| Not activated until defined|
